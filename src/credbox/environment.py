"""Reading values from the environment with one consistent rule -- a blank or whitespace-only
value counts as *absent* -- and folding an app name to its canonical env-var prefix.

credbox resolves both directories (an ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` or a per-app override) and the
active layout (``CREDBOX_LAYOUT``) from the environment. In every case an empty string must
read as "not set" rather than as an explicit empty value, so an exported-but-blank variable
falls through to the default instead of overriding it with nothing.
