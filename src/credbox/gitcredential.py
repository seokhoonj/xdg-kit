"""The ``git-credential-credbox`` adapter: speak git's credential protocol over stdin/stdout,
backed by a credbox store.

git invokes ``git-credential-credbox <get|store|erase>`` and writes ``key=value`` lines to stdin,
terminated by a blank line. The mapping is: the git ``host`` is the credbox ``app``, the git
``username`` is the credbox secret ``name``, and the password is the secret value.

The helper uses the plaintext file store (``default_backend()``); it does not consult the OS
keyring, so a credential stored with ``credbox set --keyring`` is not served here.

Two scope notes: the store is keyed by host only, so on a ``get`` for a plaintext ``http://``
request the helper serves nothing (it cannot distinguish an http-stored from an https-stored
value, and handing one to git over cleartext would be a downgrade). A host git sends with a port
(``example.com:8443``) or as an IPv6 literal is encoded to a valid store segment, consistently
across get/store/erase.

Leak-surface discipline: on ``get`` the only thing written to stdout is the credential
reply (``username=...\npassword=...``); on any error nothing is written to stdout (git treats an
empty reply as "no credential") and a content-free note goes to stderr -- never the secret, never
a traceback.
