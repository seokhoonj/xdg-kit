"""Domain exception hierarchy for credbox.

Every error credbox raises on purpose derives from ``CredBoxError``, so a caller can handle
this package's failures with a single ``except`` without catching unrelated bugs. Each leaf
states its bases explicitly: ``InvalidAppNameError`` is also a ``ValueError`` (a bad literal
name is a caller mistake) and ``MissingExtraError`` is also an ``ImportError`` (a missing
optional dependency), so an ``except ValueError`` / ``except ImportError`` still catches them.

    JSON object, a non-string value), or the backend it needs is absent. Built from safe

    never chained to an exception whose text could embed one."""

    would leak."""

    The context-manager form treats "not acquired" as an error so protected work never runs
    unguarded; use ``single_instance(app, name=...)`` instead when the intent is to skip -- it
    yields ``False`` rather than raising. Distinct from the ``CredBoxError`` that ``acquire`` raises
