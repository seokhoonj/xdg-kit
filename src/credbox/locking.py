"""A best-effort single-instance lock, so two runs of the same job do not overlap.

Overlapping runs -- a cron job and a manual one, or two crons -- can double-spend a paid API,
deliver duplicates, and race on shared state. A ``FileLock`` holds an exclusive advisory lock
on a file in ``runtime_dir(app)`` (where the XDG spec says locks belong) for as long as it is
held, and reports whether it was acquired, so a caller can skip a run already in progress
rather than pile on.

Built on ``fcntl.flock`` (POSIX) and ``msvcrt.locking`` (Windows) via ``_oslock`` -- both
released by the OS automatically when the process exits, even on a crash, so there is no stale
lock to clean up. On a platform with neither, it is a no-op that always acquires.
