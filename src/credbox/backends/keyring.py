"""The OS keyring backend ([keyring] extra), with a file ``fallback`` for headless machines.

When the OS keyring has no backend (cron, containers, servers) the operation is delegated to
``fallback`` in full and a one-time, content-free warning is printed so the user knows their
secrets are in the file, not the keyring. When the keyring works it is authoritative, and a
successful write/delete also clears any stale plaintext copy from the fallback.

**Leak contract.** A keyring call can raise a third-party exception whose ``str()``
embeds a secret. Every such exception is caught *inside* a returning-frame helper
(``_try_keyring_*``) and never escapes; the ``CredentialsError`` a caller sees is built from safe
fields only (``app``, ``name``, a fixed phrase) and raised where no exception is in flight, so
both ``__cause__`` AND ``__context__`` are ``None`` (a bare ``raise ... from None`` would leave
the secret-bearing exception on ``__context__``). The warn-once message is content-free too.

One direction cannot be fully closed: a value written to the file fallback *while the keyring is
down* is not migrated into the keyring on recovery. If on recovery the keyring holds no entry for
that name, ``get`` consults the file and returns it; but if the keyring still holds an older value,
that older value shadows the newer file value (the keyring is authoritative on a conflict).
Re-set the key while the keyring is reachable.

#
# Each helper catches every keyring exception INSIDE its own frame and returns a status string,
# so the exception never reaches a caller frame. That is what lets KeyringBackend raise a
# content-free CredentialsError with __context__ == None: at the raise site there is no exception
# in flight to become the implicit context. The `import keyring` guard is `except Exception` (not
# just ImportError) because executing keyring's __init__ (backend/D-Bus discovery) can raise a
# non-ImportError, which must be folded into a status here rather than escape as a raw traceback
# whose frame retains `raw`.
#
# The catch is deliberately total -- it does NOT re-raise MemoryError the way _storecodec/scrub do.
# All three run with a secret in frame (_try_keyring_set holds `raw`), so the difference is not
# "who has a secret" but what swallowing PRODUCES. _storecodec/scrub let MemoryError propagate only
# because their swallow-alternative is worse than the frame-locals exposure -- a misclassified
# fault, or a returned still-unscrubbed string. Here swallowing yields a safe status instead ("failed"
# -> fail-closed raise; "no_backend" -> file fallback), so there is nothing to trade: folding a
# swallowed OOM to a status keeps `raw` off the propagating traceback at no cost. BaseException
# (KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit) is not an Exception, so it still propagates -- carrying no secret
# text of its own, though `raw` would sit in this frame; that is the interpreter tearing down.
