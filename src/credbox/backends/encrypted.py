"""The encrypted file backend ([crypto] extra): a single AES-GCM blob keyed by an Argon2id hash
of a passphrase.

TERMINAL -- there is no fallback: a decrypt failure (wrong passphrase or tampering) FAILS CLOSED
with a content-free ``DecryptionError``, never a plaintext downgrade. The store is ONE atomically
written file so a header and ciphertext cannot desync:

    header_len(4, big-endian) || header(JSON) || nonce(12) || ciphertext_and_tag

The header carries all KDF params and is bound as the AES-GCM associated data (AAD), so params or
version cannot be downgraded unauthenticated. The key is re-derived from the header's own params
on read (after clamping them, so a tampered header cannot force a huge Argon2id allocation before
the tag check can reject it). A fresh nonce is drawn per encryption and never reused with a key.
